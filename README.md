#The Night Before Deadline
##The Game
It's the night before your final deadline and in a hurry to finish, you've snuck into the studios after hours. However, you're not the only one in a frantic rush to complete your assignment before morning. You must contend with sneaky students trying to copy your work and the only tool at your disposal is a simple light. By turning it on, you scare the students away for a little while and you are able to work faster although don't leave the light on too long - security is roaming around and if they see the light, it's game over.

##Core Mechanics
- Awareness of light management
- Students swarming towards the player
- Security roaming around
- Progress bar fills faster when the light is on

##Goal
The goal of the game is to fill up the progress bar before the time is up, too many enemies swarm the player or being caught by security.
